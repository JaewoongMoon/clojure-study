<!-- Including script tags from remote servers allows the remote servers to inject any content into a website. If the remote servers have vulnerabilities that allow JavaScript injection, the page served from the original server is exposed to an increased risk. If an attacker can inject any JavaScript into the original web page, then that code can retrieve additional JavaScript from any domain, bypassing Same-origin policy. The Content Security Policy HTTP Header lets web sites tell web browsers which domain scripts may be included from.
